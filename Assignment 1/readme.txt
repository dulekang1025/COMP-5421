1, Purpose of program: 



This program is written in C++.



This assignment is to build a doubly linked list, LineList, which node represents one line of text. 



The line has data, which is text, length and capacity. Class can do some operation such as push back, push front, pop and remove.



For the linked list, it uses two dummy node at beginning and end of the list as head and tail. Each node has two pointers points to previous and next nodes.



The list has some operations like push back, push front, insert, pop, and get.

There are also some operator overload both for Line and LineList.



2, Files in the project



There are Line.h, Line.cpp, LineList.h, LineList.cpp and LineListTestDriver.cpp in the project. And also two input files called input_a.txt 
and input_b.txt.



I added "stdafx.h" in my files in odder to run the code with visual studio.

3, How to run the program:



First, change the file address in the LineListTestDriver.cpp according to where you put your input file.

Second, run the main() method int LineListTestDriver.cpp, the program will execute and output the result in the console.
